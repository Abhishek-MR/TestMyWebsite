    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">
    <p>Start by living with a greater awareness of the resources that you use in your daily life. Pay attention to how you choose to heat, to travel, to use water and use products that were made by manufacturing practices. Awareness is what will allow you to then begin to make environmentally friendly choices.

    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">
    <p>With your new awareness of how natural resources are used in your life start to practice conservation. This can be as simple as turning off the lights as you leave a room and as complex as making different choices when it comes to building your home.

    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">
<p>Trees are necessary for us to survive. They give oxygen, fruits, clean the air, provide shelter to wildlife, prevent soil erosion. A shady landscape around your home can help you to reduce consumption of energy and keep your home cool even during summers. Plant small trees around your home, don’t cut them unless it’s necessary, work with local environmental groups to plant more trees and educate others about the positive aspects of it.

    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">
    <p>
    When you go out for shopping, try to buy products from market that are made up of recycled materials with minimal packaging i.e. the product should be environment friendly. Look into manufacturing processes to check if it was made from recycled materials or the use of plastics or chemicals was involved in its production.

    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">
<p>The 3 R’s (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) waste hierarchy is the order of priority of actions to be taken to reduce the amount of waste generated and to improve overall waste management processes and programs. Reduce simply means reducing what is produced and what is consumed. Reuse items for a different purpose instead of sending them to landfills.To recycle something means that it will be transformed again into a raw material that can be shaped into a new item.

    <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-green"><b> Use a pressure cooker</b></h1>
    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">
   <p>This is a terrific way to save time, money, and energy all at the same time. Pressure cookers can take up to 70 percent less time (and less energy) to cook a meal, and they’re more versatile than one might think: They can make chili, pot roast, soup, whole chickens, corn bread—and even desserts!

    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">
   <p> It saves gas and means fewer cars on the road—which means less carbon emissions. Plus, it’ll keep you punctual and save the passengers from all the road rage that comes with fighting rush-hour traffic.

    <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-green"><b>Think about Solar</b></h1>
    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">
   <p> People are so serious about solar energy these days that the US government now offers tax credits to homeowners who install some panels to supplement their energy expenditure. It’s not a bad deal, but for those unwilling to take the risk that the initial cost will pay off, some companies, like SunRun, SolarCity, and Roof Diagnostics, are willing to take that risk for you. If you’re in a state that they work in (and your roof gets enough sun), they’ll set everything up themselves free of charge, and shave at least 10 percent off the electricity bill by doing so.

    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">
   <p>Look for Energy Star Appliances, which cost a bit more money to buy initially, but are more durable, more environmentally friendly, and will save cash on utility bills. An Energy Star clothes washer, for instance, uses 50 percent less energy and 50 percent less water than standard washers, which means big savings… over time. You’re patient, right?

    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">
   <p>Before any big purchase, think: How often will I really use this ladder/leaf blower/wheelbarrow? If the answer is “not a lot,” it’s so easy to borrow stuff (especially if you like making “thank you” cookies). If your social network is lacking in the products you require, there are plenty of websites, like Freecycle, that help people borrow, rent, or just take whatever they might need. This is some next-level human generosity, and it’s a beautiful thing to behold.
